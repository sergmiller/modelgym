What is this about?
-------------------

Modelgym is a place (a library?) to get your predictive models as
meaningful in a smooth and effortless manner. Modelgym provides the
unified interface for

* different kind of Models (XGBoost, CatBoost etc)
  that you can tune with
* different kind of optimization strategies, or Trainers.

Usually it starts with a data sample that you can be evaluate
with our Guru interface and maybe get a few hints on preprocessing it
before starting the training. In the end of the trials you get a report
of the model performance on both cross-validation and hold-out samples.
So you can pick the top model along the best hyperparameters for your
case.
